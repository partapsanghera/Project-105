In last project we coded to find the central tendency (mean,median,mode).

In this project we learned how to code the standard deviation.

We first looked at the formula of standard deviation and understood the process 

What we do:
1.) Find the mean of the data
2.) Subtracted the mean from all the values and squared it.
3.) Got the sum of the squared list
4.) Divided the sum by the number of values.
5.) Found the square root of the results.
